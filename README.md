### =================Attendance and Payroll Features================= <br>
<span style="color:blue">**CheckIns&Outs:**</span><br>
Our attendance and payroll project manages employee Login and Logout times seamlessly. It tracks attendance data through secure login sessions, ensuring accurate payroll calculations.
One of the reasons why the attendance management system is important is because it helps employers to check the overall performance of the employee. Using the timesheet, the employer will be able to check when the employee arrives and leaves. Also, the total hours the employee gave to the company on a daily basis.<br>
<span style="color:blue">**Leave Management:**</span><br>
      Although some employers want to keep employees at work all the time, they need their fair share of time-off to rest and recuperate. An overworked employee is an unproductive one. Leave management is the process of managing employee time-off requests in a fair, accurate, and efficient way.<br>
      <span style="color:blue">**Time Permission:**</span><br>
      In our attendance and payroll project, Time Permission features empower employees to request and manage their time-off requests digitally. This streamlines scheduling and ensures compliance with company policies, enhancing workforce efficiency and satisfaction.<br>
       <span style="color:blue">**Payroll:**</span><br>
     Payroll management is the administrative task of compensating employees for services rendered. It also provides a financial record of employee gross earnings, payroll deductions and net pay, as well as the employer's related payroll tax liability.
     Payroll can be defined as the process of paying a company's employees. It         includes collecting the list of employees to be paid, tracking the hours worked, calculating the employee's pay, distributing the salary on time, and recording the payroll expense.<br>
<span style="color:blue">**Reporting:**</span><br>
In our attendance and payroll project, employees can generate and submit detailed reports to administrators. This feature streamlines communication and enhances transparency between employees and management, fostering efficient decision-making processes.<br>
